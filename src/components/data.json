        "summary": "Md Shoaib Akhtar shows strong alignment with the full stack developer position at Deveryware, particularly regarding core web development experience, AWS/cloud skills, and modern frontend/backend experience (ReactJS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Django REST, PostgreSQL, AWS, etc.). He has a solid foundation in RESTful services, database integration, and collaborative team delivery, while his contributions demonstrate meaningful impact in application efficiency and security. However, several gaps exist in hands-on experience with Node.js, Angular, Docker, Kubernetes, and working in European/regulatory environments. There is also limited mention of hybrid/progressive/native app delivery, distributed systems scope, and requirements for English/French proficiency. Overall, his credentials align well with the technical and collaborative culture sought, but targeted improvements are needed to reach a strong match.",
